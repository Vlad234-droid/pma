        We all have strengths and development areas. Feedback is all about helping you be the best you can be. When
        receiving feedback, think about these four elements:
      </p>
      <ol className={css(orderedList)}>
        <li>
          <b>Take a step back.</b> Take time to reflect on the feedback you&apos;ve received, don&apos;t feel like you
          must take action right away. If you&apos;re having a bad day, you&apos;re more likely to receive feedback
          negatively, so making sure you&apos;re in a positive frame of mind where you can stay curious about your
          feedback will set you up to receive feedback as constructive and well meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember to stay <b>balanced</b>: If you only focus on your developmental feedback, you risk overlooking the
          value of positive feedback, but focusing only on your positive feedback can create blind spots. It&apos;s
          important to take a balanced perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Separate opinions and facts.</b> Focus on the facts in your feedback, these will be helpful when you start
          to plan what you&apos;ll do next. Opinions are also worth considering as this shows how you come across to an
          individual but remember someone&apos;s opinion is just one perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be <b>future focused.</b> Feedback is about learning from the past to make a plan for the future. Try not to
          dwell on what didnâ€™t go so well in the past, use those examples to make a plan of action so in the future your
          contribution can be even better.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p className={css(PreRecomendationInfo)}>Remember:</p>
      <ul className={css(dotsList)}>
        <li>make your good intentions clear</li>
        <li>be specific about the situation</li>
        <li>describe the behaviour you observed</li>
        <li>highlight the impact it had</li>
      </ul>
      <p className={css(PreRecomendationInfo, { marginTop: '8px' })}>
        If you want to learn more about your feedback, speak to the colleague who shared the feedback. This is a great
        way to understand more about the feedback they shared and when they observed it. Remember to take time to
        reflect on the feedback before you approach them, so the conversation is constructive. Having open conversations
        helps you to build great relationships with your colleagues.
